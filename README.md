# -Zomato-Data-analysis-Machine-Learning
This project involves scraping data from food delivery site Zomato for our model, and after scraping the data, I extract some useful business insights and make a machine learning model and a recommendation website.
# 1st table:
I start by creating a first table and giving some of its columns the following names:

1.retaurant_ID: giving each restaurant a distinct ID

2.Url of the restaurant

3.name:name of the restaurant

4.rating: rating of the restaurant

5.price_for_one

6.cusine

# 2nd table:
1.retaurant_ID :Unique ID to identify the restaurant(Primary Key)

2.latitude

3.longitude

4.location

5.delivery_review_number

-->I combined both tables in the following step to create the new one, and then I preprocessed the data.
  Now we have the complete data with us to build a machine learning model
  To see the code and model refer to the .ipynb files.
